If evaluation ignores that gap, teams get a false sense of readiness.\n\n## The limits of standard \"accuracy\"\n\nFor procedural tasks, classic metrics can over-reward the easy parts:\n\n- action verbs,\n- frequent entities,\n- common step patterns.\n\nThe hard parts are less frequent but more important:\n\n- threshold conditions,\n- decision branches,\n- exception paths,\n- role-specific approvals.\n\nIf a system misses one high-risk guard and captures twenty low-risk steps, aggregate accuracy can still look strong. Operationally, that is still a failing system.\n\n## A metric suite aligned with risk\n\nI use a metric set that separates structural correctness from safety-critical fidelity.\n\n| Metric | What it checks | Why it matters |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Step F1 | Core step extraction quality | Baseline structural coverage |\n| Adjacency fidelity | Correct step ordering and transitions | Process logic continuity |\n| Constraint coverage | Recovery of required conditions and guards | Safety-critical completeness |\n| Decision-point fidelity | Preservation of branch nodes and branch criteria | Correct behavior under variation |\n| Exception recall | Capture of warnings and prohibited actions | Prevents silent hazardous omissions |\n| Traceability score | Presence of source-span evidence per extracted claim | Supports audit and review |\n\nThis split makes failures visible where aggregate metrics hide them.\n\n## Severity weighting changes decisions\n\nNot all errors are equal. Missing a unit label and missing a lockout precondition should not carry the same penalty.\n\nI recommend assigning severity classes in the gold standard:\n\n- **Critical**: omission can directly affect safety-critical action.\n- **Major**: omission can degrade decision quality or compliance.\n- **Minor**: omission has low operational consequence.\n\nThen compute a severity-weighted error index alongside base metrics.\n\nSimple form:\n\n```\nWeightedError = sum(severity_weight_i * error_i) / sum(severity_weight_i)\n```\n\nUse weights that domain experts agree on, not arbitrary values decided only by engineers.\n\n## Constraint coverage should be explicit\n\nConstraint coverage is often treated as a side metric. In my experience, it should be a primary release gate for procedural systems.\n\nPractical definition:\n\n```\nConstraintCoverage = matched_constraints / gold_constraints\n```\n\nBut matching needs discipline:\n\n- match by semantic equivalence, not only string overlap,\n- require linkage to the correct step,\n- verify scope boundaries when the same term appears in multiple sections.\n\nA condition extracted in the wrong place is not a partial success. It is a structural error.\n\n## Evaluation protocol that scales\n\nA useful protocol for applied research-to-pilot work:\n\n1. Build a gold set with mixed complexity (easy, medium, edge-case documents).\n2. Annotate steps, transitions, constraints, exceptions, and severity labels.\n3. Run extraction with fixed config and seeded decoding for reproducibility.\n4. Compute metric suite and failure taxonomy.\n5. Review error clusters with domain experts.\n6. Update chunking, prompts, or validators.\n7. Re-run on unchanged gold set before adding new data.\n\nThe key is resisting metric drift. If the gold set changes every cycle, your trend lines become hard to trust.\n\n## Failure taxonomy is as important as scores\n\nRaw numbers tell you \"how much.\" Taxonomy tells you \"why.\"\n\nUseful failure classes:\n\n- condition dropped,\n- condition mis-scoped,\n- step merge,\n- hallucinated transition,\n- exception omitted,\n- role misassignment,\n- source citation missing.\n\nWhen you track these categories over iterations, you can see whether improvements come from real behavior change or from scoring artifacts.\n\n## Add abstention quality to your dashboard\n\nA mature system should know when it is unsure.\n\nTrack:\n\n- abstention rate,\n- abstention precision (how often abstention was justified),\n- high-risk false accept rate.\n\nIn safety-adjacent workflows, a thoughtful abstention is usually better than a confident error with polished prose.\n\n## Latency and reliability still belong in evaluation\n\nEvaluation cannot ignore operational constraints. Even high-quality extraction is unusable if latency is unstable or failures are opaque.\n\nMinimum operational metrics:\n\n- p50/p95 end-to-end latency,\n- stage-level latency breakdown,\n- validation failure rate,\n- retry and timeout rates,\n- reproducibility delta across repeated runs.\n\nFor partner-facing pilots, include these in the same report as semantic metrics. Keeping them separate usually delays integration issues until late stages.\n\n## A practical release gate template\n\nBefore promoting a model/pipeline version, require all of the following:\n\n- Step F1 above target threshold,\n- constraint coverage above target threshold,\n- zero unresolved critical-severity errors on benchmark set,\n- traceability score above minimum,\n- latency SLO met at p95,\n- no regression in top failure classes over previous version.\n\nThis is stricter than typical ML dashboards. It is also closer to what industrial partners expect once real workflows depend on the system.\n\n## What I would prioritize next\n\n- Better automated scoring for condition scope correctness.\n- Shared benchmark fragments across organizations without exposing sensitive text.\n- Confidence calibration that maps to true error likelihood per error class.\n- Review tools that connect each metric regression to concrete examples immediately.\n\nEvaluation is not the final chapter after model building. In applied industrial AI, evaluation is the control loop that decides whether a prototype is trustworthy enough to become a pilot.","tags":["evaluation","industrial-ai","safety","procedural-knowledge-extraction","reliability"],"published_date":"2026-02-04T09:10:00+00:00","updated_at":"2026-02-04T09:10:00+00:00","read_time":5,"image_url":"https://miro.medium.com/1*d3PZ7JqYIy_ENB2zuUOk3Q.jpeg"};</script>
